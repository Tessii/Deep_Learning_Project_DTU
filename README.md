With the recent advancements in computing power, the possibilities in Machine Learning are increasing. However,  obtaining sufficient labeled data to train models remains a key challenge. One way of solving this problem is the use of Semi-Supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models. Thereby, learnings from a small amount of labeled data are transferred to a bigger unlabelled dataset. In this research, the proposed models M1 and M2 from Kingma are firstly replicated, then explored, and lastly compared with alternative models to classify unlabeled data .
