# Deep_Learning_Project_DTU
A Semi Supervised Learning project for the Deep Learning course at the Danish Technical University.

With the recent advancements in computing power, the possibilities in Machine Learning are increasing. However,  obtaining sufficient labeled data to train models remains a key challenge. One way of solving this problem is the use of Semi-Supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models. Thereby, learnings from a small amount of labeled data are transferred to a bigger unlabelled dataset. In this research, the proposed models M1 and M2 from Kingma are firstly replicated, then explored, and lastly compared with alternative models to classify unlabeled data . 

The project replicates the structure of the semi supervised learning paper:
